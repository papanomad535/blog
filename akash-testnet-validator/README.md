My expertise with Akash began from the newsflash in a messenger, where has been declared the tesnet at Stage 3 on Akash community has begun. I had an adventure with conducting a validator nodes in a few other projects. Akash was the starting point to learn about the new sort of blockchain architecture and get my initial experience using a Tendermint blockchain.

The Akash staff and community I got in, seems pretty friendly and useful. There was no lack of people keen to talk about their knowledge. It took me a few times to catch up and in order to dip somewhat profound in Akash network.

In this time I've learned the principles of Cosmos established validators, improved my understanding of Linux administration. True I had any problems connecting validator to peers on testnet because of community highload, therefore I couldn't keep the validator node greater than 80% uptime for among their competition, but like I experimented a whole lot, it gave me quite promising understanding. Now it appears simple to conduct validator, RPC and API node simultaneously, but was not look so at the beginning.
